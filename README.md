AdverseEffectsPredictor
==========

##Description

This is a database and prediction algorithm which can be used to store (adverse) side-effect/chemical structure relationships and use this information in the prediction of side-effects in other compounds based on the comparison of pre-defined binary fingerprints and related statistics.

##Where does the data originate from?

Data from the [SIDER 2](http://sideeffects.embl.de/) database is used as a test-set for the compound-adverse effect relationship.

Additional information is gathered from:
  - asd
  - asd
  - asd

##Predictors used
The binary fingerprints which are deduced from the compounds and used in the prediction of side-effects are the following:
- Chemical groups
- logP  (Partition coefficient)
- Molecular mass
- Protein targets
- Metabolite forming
- Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System (ATC) code

Gene expression data (Omics) is also used as an additional resource in the prediction.
