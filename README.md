==========

##Description

This database and tool can be used to store side-effect/chemical structure relationships and use this information in the prediction of side-effects in other compounds based on comparing pre-defined binary fingerprints.

##What data is used?

Data is used from [SIDER 2](http://sideeffects.embl.de/) (Kuhn M, Campillos M, Letunic I, Jensen LJ, Bork P.
A side effect resource to capture phenotypic effects of drugs. Mol Syst Biol. 2010;6:343. Epub 2010 Jan 19.)



##Fingerprints used
The binary fingerprints which are deduced from the compounds and used in the prediction of side-effects are the following:
- Chemical groups
- logP  (Partition coefficient)
- Molecular mass

Gene expression data (Omics) can be added to allow for additional evidence.
